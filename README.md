# JPMC Work- A simple dashboard for traders
## For 2 stock prices (ABC and DEF)

This project displays the ratio between 2 stock prices ABC and DEF. It auto-updates the data and the graph refelcts any updates to the data sent back. This would allow a trader to track and make possible trading opportunities. Given a -/+10% historical correlation we also display static upper and lower bounds to indicate and alert if the ratio moves too far from this. We also diplay a "trigger alert" if the ratio excedes a set threshold (ie the ratio moves from below lower bound to above upper bound).
